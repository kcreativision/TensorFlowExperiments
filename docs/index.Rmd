### Contents
The following TensorFlow trials are checked with a few datasets available in Keras API:
1. TensorFlow with basic dense layers (128, 10) on FMNIST dataset.    
    Check its general structure, summary, TensorBoard outputs and my analysis [here]()
2. TensorFlow with basic dense layers (128, 10) on MNIST dataset.   
    Check its general structure, summary, TensorBoard outputs and my analysis [here]()


All these trials are available for analyses on TensorBoard here


### Dimensionality Flow
The general dimensionality flow of building a dense neural network is as follows:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
DiagrammeR::mermaid("dimensionality_flow.mmd", width=1500, height=1200)
```

The diagram is created using [Mermaid](https://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/mermaid.html).
