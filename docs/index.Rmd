```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(DiagrammeR)
```

This is my course notes for [this Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow/). I would be
adding more details as I go through other courses/resources connected to this topic.

### Dimensionality Flow
The general dimensionality flow of building a dense neural network is as follows:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
DiagrammeR::mermaid("dimensionality_flow.mmd", width=1500, height=1200)
```

The diagram is created using [Mermaid](https://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/mermaid.html).
